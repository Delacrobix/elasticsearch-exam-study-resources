# Exercises by Guido Lena Cota

This exercises was extracted from the [blog post by Guido Lena Cota.](https://kreuzwerker.de/en) The original exercises has written for Elasticsearch 6, for that reason, I have updated some of the exercises to match with the version 8 of Elasticsearch.

## Order

All the exercises are independent, so you can do them in any order you want, but Guido has ordered them in the following way:

1. [Store data into Elasticsearch](store-data-into-elasticsearch.md)
2. [Model Data into Elasticsearch](model-data-into-elasticsearch.md)
3. [Search and Aggregations](search-and-aggregations.md)
