# Elasticsearch Certified exam study resources

Here is a list of resources that I used to study for the Elasticsearch Certified Engineer exam. I share them with you in case you find them useful.

## `.es` files

I used the VSCode extension [Elasticsearch for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ria.elastic) that allows you to run queries and see the results directly in the editor. However, I personally recommend using Kibana Devtools for studying and using `.es` files to save your queries.

## Folders

In each folder, you can find descriptions of the resources that I used to study for the exam.

It's highly recommended for starters in Elasticsearch. The course covers the basics of Elasticsearch and little advances topics. Also includes bonus content like how to use Kibana and Logstash.
