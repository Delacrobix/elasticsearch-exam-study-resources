# Elasticsearch Certified exam study resources

Here is a list of resources that I used to study for the Elasticsearch Certified Engineer exam. I share them with you in case you find them useful.

## `.es` files

I used the VSCode extension [Elasticsearch for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ria.elastic) that allows you to run queries and see the results directly in the editor. However, I personally recommend using Kibana Devtools for studying and using `.es` files to save your queries.

## Folders

In each folder, you can find descriptions of the resources that I used to study for the exam.
